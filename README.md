# Birthday-Reminder
CS4640 Project

Alexander Monaco & Shreyas Mehta

This is a project we worked on during our CS4640 Programming Languages for Web Applications class. In the class, we were tasked with developing a website from scratch and implementing new features (backend, sessions, Angular, etc.) across the different assignments. 

Ultimately, our project is designed so that users can login and keep track of their friends and family members' birthdays without having to use an API or social media. It will also give you notifications on the site if you have bithdays coming up in the next week (we were unable to add email or text notifications during the class for logisitcal reasons). 

This code works, but is a little messy, with few comments and an Angular page had an issue during the demonstration. Regardless, this was an important project in learning how to design a website from scratch and the importance of planning ahead when working with multiple technologies.
